# Sun Simulator - Project Specification

## Project Overview
A web-based interactive simulation that visualizes the complete lifecycle of a star, from its birth in a nebula through its various evolutionary stages, culminating in its dramatic death as a supernova. Built with Three.js for impressive visual presentation.

## Project Goals
- Create a visually dramatic and engaging simulation of stellar evolution
- Creatively model the lifecycle of a star with enough scientific grounding to justify the "simulator" name
- Demonstrate gravitational effects and stellar processes in an accessible, impressive way
- Build a portfolio piece suitable for bootcamp demo presentation
- Balance visual spectacle with conceptual accuracy (leaning toward drama)

## Simulation Phases

### Phase 1: Stellar Birth (Nebula to Protostar)
- **Initial State**: Vast interstellar gas and dust cloud (nebula)
- **Process**: Gravitational collapse of the nebula
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Swirling gas and dust particles
  - Gradual concentration of matter toward center
  - Formation of accretion disk
  - Initial heat generation (infrared glow)
- **Duration**: Accelerated time-lapse (represents ~100,000 years)

### Phase 2: Main Sequence Star
- **Process**: Hydrogen fusion begins in the core
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Stable, bright yellow-white star
  - Solar surface activity (sunspots, solar flares)
  - Radiating light and heat
  - Corona effects
- **Duration**: Majority of simulation time (represents billions of years)
- **Solar System Integration**: Star becomes the center of a planetary system with Earth in orbit

### Phase 3: Red Giant Phase
- **Process**: Hydrogen exhaustion, helium fusion begins
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Dramatic expansion of star's outer layers
  - Color shift from yellow to red-orange
  - Increased luminosity
  - Possible ejection of outer layers
- **Duration**: Extended transition period

### Phase 4: Death - Supernova
- **Process**: Core collapse and explosive ejection of stellar material
- **Visual Elements**:
  - Rapid brightening
  - Catastrophic explosion with shockwave
  - Ejection of heavy elements into space
  - Formation of remnant (neutron star or black hole)
  - Expanding nebula of ejected material
- **Duration**: Dramatic, high-energy sequence

### Phase 5: Black Hole Formation and Accretion
- **Process**: Supernova remnant collapses into a singularity with event horizon
- **Visual Elements**:
  - **Event Horizon**: Shader-based spacetime distortion with gravitational warping
  - **Accretion Disk**: Ring of superheated material with temperature-based color gradients (blue-white core → orange → red edges)
  - **Accretion Streams**: Spiraling particle streams feeding the black hole from distant orbital positions
  - **Relativistic Jets**: Shader-based polar beams with flowing synchrotron radiation effects
  - **Gravitational Lensing**: Light-bending photon ring (basic implementation, enhancement planned)
  - **Mass Growth**: Black hole visibly grows as it consumes matter, jets intensify proportionally
- **Physics Inspiration**:
  - Schwarzschild radius scaling (Rs ∝ M)
  - Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) at 3× Schwarzschild radius
  - Jet collimation (20-50% of event horizon radius)
  - Blandford-Znajek process (energy extraction via magnetic fields)
- **Duration**: Continuous accretion process, demonstrates black hole dynamics

## Technical Requirements

### Core Technologies
- **Platform**: Web Browser
- **Graphics Engine**: Three.js (WebGL-based 3D rendering)
- **Physics Simulation**: Simplified gravitational physics for visual effect (not full n-body simulation)
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Performance**: Real-time rendering with smooth animation, optimized for demo purposes

### Features
- **Time Controls**: Play, pause, speed up/slow down simulation
- **Camera Controls**: Zoom, pan, rotate view (orbital controls)
- **Phase Indicators**: Show current lifecycle stage
- **Simple Info Display**: Basic stats about what's happening
- **Auto-play Mode**: Simulation runs through entire lifecycle automatically
- **Visual Effects Priority**: Emphasis on impressive particle effects, lighting, and transitions

### Visual Requirements
- Dramatic color representation (temperature-based but enhanced for visual appeal)
- Heavy particle effects for gas, dust, and stellar material
- Impressive lighting effects (lens flares, glow, bloom, HDR)
- Gravitational effects visible through particle motion
- Artistic liberty prioritized for "wow factor" while maintaining conceptual accuracy
- Smooth, cinematic transitions between lifecycle phases

### User Experience
- Intuitive, minimal UI that doesn't distract from visuals
- Smooth, cinematic transitions between lifecycle phases
- Easy to demo - should be impressive within 2-3 minutes
- Clean, modern interface suitable for portfolio presentation
- Performance optimized for presentation on typical laptops

## Design Philosophy
**"Spectacular Science"** - Prioritize visual drama and impressive effects while maintaining enough scientific grounding to justify calling it a simulator. Think "science documentary" rather than "physics textbook." The goal is to impress and engage while demonstrating technical skills and conceptual understanding of stellar evolution and gravitational physics.

## Target Audience
- Primary: Bootcamp instructors and colleagues (demo/portfolio piece)
- Secondary: Personal amusement and learning
- Demo Context: Should make a strong impression in 2-3 minute presentation

## Key Constraints
- Must run smoothly in web browser
- Should be demo-ready (not overly complex to explain)
- Balance realism with performance
- Prioritize visual impact over scientific precision
